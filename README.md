# CodePatterns
Examples of coding patterns in C#
This project will grow to contain examples of popular coding patterns used in C# and written to be a clear reference for developers who are unfamiliar with the patterns.

It is important that each example is simple and clear so that they can be read and understood by inexperienced developers.
